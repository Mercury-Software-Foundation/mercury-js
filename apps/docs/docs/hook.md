## Mercury.js: Defining Hook Execution for Models and Actions

Mercury.js provides an advanced mechanism for adding before and after hooks to actions on your application's models. Hooks allow you to execute custom logic before or after certain operations, giving you granular control over the behavior of your data models.

## Hook Levels

Mercury.js hooks can be executed at different stages:

- **Before Hooks**: Run before an action occurs on a model.
- **After Hooks**: Run after an action occurs on a model.

Each model can have hooks attached to specific actions:

- **Create**: Executed before or after creating a new record.
- **Update**: Executed before or after modifying an existing record.
- **Delete**: Executed before or after removing an existing record.
- **Get**: Executed before or after retrieving a record.
- **Paginate**: Executed before or after paginating records.

## Hook Syntax

To define hooks, use the `mercury.hook.before` and `mercury.hook.after` methods.

### Rule Structure

```typescript
// Define a before hook
mercury.hook.before(action: string, handler: Function);

// Define an after hook
mercury.hook.after(action: string, handler: Function);
```

`mercury.hook.before` and `mercury.hook.after` are methods which allow you to specify custom logic for actions on a model.

The `action` parameter is a string that represents the specific operation on a model to which the hook is attached.

### Hook Actions

### Example

Let's assume `DOCUMENT` would be the model. Each hook can be tied to different actions such as "CREATE", "UPDATE", or "DELETE" depending on the custom logic to run.

## 1. Create Hook

In this example, we add custom logic before and after creating a new document in the Document model.

#### Before Create Hook

```typescript
import mercury from "@mercury-js/core";
// Define a before hook for the "create" action
mercury.hook.before("CREATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD", (this: any) => {
  console.log("Before Creating Document: ", this);
});
```

The `before` hook for the **"CREATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD"** action using Mercury.js executes custom logic before the "document" record is created. It also prints the context (`this`) available at the time of the hook's execution.

#### Explanation

1. **import mercury from "@mercury-js/core"**

    The Mercury.js library provides a set of tools to manage actions and models in your application. By importing mercury, you gain access to the hook mechanism that lets you define custom logic for model actions like create.

2. **mercury.hook.before("CREATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD", function(this: any){ })**

    This line registers a before hook that listens for the CREATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD event.

3. **function(this: any)**

    The function is defined with `this` bound to the current context in which the action is executed. In TypeScript, `this: any` indicates that `this` can hold any type of value.

#### What `this` Represents

The `this` context in Mercury hooks usually provides detailed information about the current operation. Here's what you might see when printing `this` in the console:

```typescript
{
    name: 'Document',
    data: { documentName: "Document" },
    user: { id: '1', profile: 'ADMIN' },
    options: {
        root: undefined,
        args: { input: [Object] },
        ctx: {
            user: [Object],
            [Symbol(realm)]: [Object],
            [Symbol(state)]: [Object],
            [Symbol(signal)]: [AbortSignal],
            [Symbol(abortController)]: [AbortController],
            [Symbol(headers)]: [HeadersList],
            [Symbol(internal request)]: [Object]
        },
        internal: false,
        populate: [],
        select: [ 'id' ]
    }
}
```

- `name`: The name of the model being processed (e.g., Document).
- `data`: The data being sent for creating the Document record.
- `user`: Information about the user performing the action, including their id and profile (e.g., ADMIN).
- `options`: Additional metadata and configuration options for the create action.
  - `root`: Root object, usually undefined for create operations.
  - `args`: Arguments passed to the action.
  - `ctx`: Context of the request, including user data, headers, and control symbols.
    - `user`: Represents additional details about the user making the request, typically used for authentication and authorization checks.
  - `internal`: Boolean indicating whether this is an internal request.
  - `populate`: Specifies which related fields to populate.
  - `select`: Fields selected for the response (e.g., id).

**Purpose of the Hook:**
This before hook gives you an opportunity to execute custom logic before the model record is created. You can inspect the `this` context to access important information, such as the data being used to create the record, the user performing the action, and the environment in which the action is happening.

### After Create Hook


### Rule Structure

```typescript
import mercury from "@mercury-js/core";
// Define an after hook for the "create" action
mercury.hook.after("CREATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD", (this: any) => {
  console.log("After Creation Of Document: ", this);
});
```

The `after` hook for the **"CREATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD"** action using Mercury.js runs a custom function after a document record is created.

#### Explanation

1. **import mercury from "@mercury-js/core"**

    The Mercury.js library provides a set of tools to manage actions and models in your application. By importing mercury, you gain access to the hook mechanism that lets you define custom logic for model actions like create.

2. **mercury.hook.after("CREATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD", function(this: any){ })**

    This line registers an after hook that listens for the CREATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD event.

3. **CREATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD**

    This string represents the specific action to which the hook is attached. In this case, it refers to the creation of a model record in a model, most likely a Document model. The hook will be executed after a document record has been created successfully.

4. **function (this: any)**

    The callback function is executed after the CREATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD action is completed. `this` refers to the context or state in which the action was executed. This is important because it contains information about what happened during the document creation process.

#### What `this` Represents

When printing `this` in the console, the object will likely contain:

```typescript
{
  name: 'Document',
  record: {
    _id: new ObjectId('123'),
    DocumentName: 'Document',
    createdOn: 2024-09-22T14:50:46.367Z,
    updatedOn: 2024-09-22T14:50:46.367Z,
    id: '123'
  },
  user: { profile: 'ADMIN' },
  options: {
    root: { mercuryResolvers: [Object] },
    args: { input: [Object] },
    ctx: {
      user: [Object],
      [Symbol(kCapture)]: false,
      [Symbol(kHeaders)]: [Object],
      [Symbol(kHeadersCount)]: 32,
      [Symbol(kTrailers)]: null,
      [Symbol(kTrailersCount)]: 0
    },
    internal: false,
    populate: [],
    select: ['id', 'name']
  }
}
```

- `name`: Specifies the name of the model being processed. In this case, it is set to 'Document', indicating the operation involves a document-related entity in the system.
- `record`: Stores all the details about the document. It represents the actual document being created or updated in the database.
- `user`: Contains metadata about the user who is performing the operation, such as creating or updating a document.
  - `profile`: Represents the role or profile of the user making the request (e.g., 'ADMIN'). This field may be used to apply permissions or role-based access control during the operation.
- `options`: Contains additional metadata about the request, including resolver information, arguments, and selection options.
  - `root`: Connects to the database and handles how the model is processed based on the query or mutation.
  - `args`: Captures the input provided to the operation, such as form data or request parameters. In GraphQL operations, this includes the input fields for mutations or queries (like the documentName).
  - `ctx`: Context of the request, including user data, headers, and control symbols.
    - `user`: Represents additional details about the user making the request, typically used for authentication and authorization checks.
  - `internal`: Boolean indicating whether this is an internal request.
  - `populate`: Specifies which related fields to populate.
  - `select`: Fields selected for the response (e.g., id, name).

**Purpose of the Hook:**
The after hook allows you to perform tasks or trigger logic after the document creation has been finalized. Some common use cases include:

- Logging information about the created document.
- Triggering additional workflows, such as sending notifications.
- Updating related data or records based on the newly created document.
- Auditing and tracking creation events for monitoring or debugging purposes.

## 2.Update Hook

This hook allows you to execute logic before and after updating a document record.

### Before Create Hook

### Rule Structure

```typescript
import mercury from "@mercury-js/core";
// Define a before hook for the "create" action
mercury.hook.before("UPDATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD", (this:any) => {
  console.log("Before Updating  Document: ", this);
});
```

<!-- before  allows you to define custom logic that is executed before the update action is performed on the document model.ou can use this hook to pre-validate or modify the data before updating the document or to log and inspect information for debugging. -->

before hook for the **"UPDATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD"** action using the Mercury.The hook executes custom logic before the update action is performed on the document model.You can use this hook to pre-validate or modify the data before updating the document or to log and inspect information for debugging

### Explanation

#### 1. import mercury from "@mercury-js/core"

    The Mercury.js library provides a set of tools to manage actions and models in your application. By importing mercury, you gain access to the hook mechanism that lets you define custom logic for model action like update.

#### 2.mercury.hook.before("UPDATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD", function(this: any){ })

       This line registers a before hook that listens for the UPDATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD event.

#### 3.UPDATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD

        This string represents the specific action to which the hook is attached. In this case, it refers to the updation of a model record in a model, most likely a Document model. The hook will be executed before a document record has been updating.

#### 4.function (this: any)

       The callback function is executed before the UPDATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD action.
       this refers to the context or state in which the action is executing. This is important because it contains information about what happened during the document updation process.
       this is used to capture the context of the action being processed.

#### What _this_ Represents

       When printing this in the console, the object will likely contain:

       ```typescript

       {

name: 'Document',
prevRecord: {
\_id: new ObjectId('123'),
documentName: 'Document',

    createdOn: 2024-09-20T06:48:09.999Z,
    updatedOn: 2024-09-20T07:07:12.799Z,
    __v: 0,
    id: '123'

},

populate: [],
select: [ 'id', 'documentName']
}
}

````


- `name`: The name of the model being processed (e.g., Document).

- `prevRecord`: Holds details about the previous version of the document before the update (e.g., name,).

- `record`: Represents the updated version of the document (e.g., the new name after the update).

- `user`: Contains metadata about the user performing the operation (profile as 'ADMIN').

- `options`: Contains extra metadata about the request:

         - root: Links to database query processing.

         - args: Captures input arguments for the update.

         - ctx: Provides the context of the request, including HTTP details and user info.

         -  internal: Specifies whether the request is internal (set to false).
         -  select: Defines which fields are selected for the response.

**Purpose of the Hook:**
- The after hook allows performing tasks or triggering logic after the document update has been completed. Common use cases include:

- Logging information about the updated document.
- Triggering workflows, such as sending notifications related to the updated project.
- Updating related data or records based on the newly updated document.
- Auditing and tracking update events for monitoring or debugging purposes.

### After Update Hook:

### Rule Structure

```typescript
import mercury from "@mercury-js/core";
// Define an after hook for the "create" action
mercury.hook.after("UPDATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD", (this: any) => {
  console.log("After  Document Updation: ", this);
});

````

This **"UPDATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD"** hook allows custom logic to execute after a document is updated. It's useful for post-update processing like logging, triggering additional workflows, or syncing data to other systems

### Explanation

#### 1. import mercury from "@mercury-js/core"

Mercury.js provides the tools to handle actions and events in your application. By importing Mercury, you can define hooks for various model actions, such as after updating a document.

#### 2. mercury.hook.after("UPDATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD", function(this: any){ })

Registers an after hook that listens for the "UPDATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD" event. The hook will trigger after a document record has been updated.

#### 3. "UPDATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD"

This string represents the specific action tied to the update of a document model record. The hook runs after the document update process is completed.

#### 4. function (this: any)

The callback function is executed after the "UPDATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD" action, providing access to the context and state at the time of the update.

#### What this Represents

After the document is updated, the this object will contain relevant information about the update process:

```typescript
{
  name: 'Document',
  prevRecord: {
    _id: new ObjectId('123'),
    documentName: 'Old Document Name',
    createdOn: 2024-09-20T06:48:09.999Z,
    updatedOn: 2024-09-22T07:07:12.799Z,
    __v: 0,
    id: '123'
  },
  record: {
    _id: new ObjectId('123'),
    documentName: 'New Document Name',
    updatedOn: 2024-09-23T08:45:12.799Z,
    id: '123'
  },
  data: { id: '123', documentName: 'New Document Name' },
  user: { profile: 'ADMIN' },
  options: {
    root: { mercuryResolvers: [Object] },
    args: { input: [Object] },
    ctx: {
      url: '/update',
      method: 'POST',
      body: [Object],
      user: [Object],
      res: [ServerResponse]
    },
    internal: false,
    populate: [],
    select: ['id', 'documentName']
  }
}

```

- `name`: Refers to the entity being updated (in this case, a "Document").
- `prevRecord`: Contains the previous state of the document before the update.
- `record`: Represents the new updated document data (e.g., updated name or timestamps).

- Notifications: Trigger notifications or alerts based on the document update.
- Data Synchronization: Synchronize the updated document data with other systems.
- Trigger Workflows: Start additional workflows or processes after the update is complete, such as recalculating dependent data or generating reports.

## 3.Delete Hook

This hooks allows you to execute logic before and after deleting a document record.

### Before Delete Hook

### Rule Struture

```typescript
import mercury from "@mercury-js/core";
mercury.hook.before("DELETE_DOCUMENT_RECORD", (this:any) => {
  console.log("Before Deleting Document: ", this);
});
```

`before` hook for the **_"DELETE_DOCUMENT_RECORD"_** action using the Mercury. The hook executes the custom logic before the delete action is performed on the document model. you can use this hook to pre-validate or modify the data before deleting the document or yo log and inspect information for debugging.

## 4. Get Hook

In this example, we add custom logic before and after retrieving a document in the Document model.

### Before Get Hook

### Rule Structure

```typescript
import mercury from "@mercury-js/core";
// Define a before hook for the "get" action
mercury.hook.before("GET_DOCUMENT_RECORD", (this: any) => {
  console.log("Before Retrieving Document: ", this);
});
```

`before` hook for the **"GET_DOCUMENT_RECORD"** action using Mercury.js. The hook executes custom logic before the "document" record is retrieved. It also prints the context (`this`) available at the time of the hook's execution.

### Explanation

The function is defined with `this` bound to the current context in which the action is executed. In TypeScript, `this: any` indicates that `this` can hold any type of value.

#### What this Represents

The `this` context in Mercury hooks usually provides detailed information about the current operation. Here's what you might see when printing `this` in the console:

```typescript
{
    name: 'Document',
    query: { id: '123' },
    user: { id: '1', profile: 'ADMIN' },

- `query`: The query parameters used to retrieve the Document record.
- `user`: Information about the user performing the action, including their id and profile (e.g., ADMIN).
- `options`: Additional metadata and configuration options for the get action.

**Purpose of the Hook:**
This before hook gives you an opportunity to execute custom logic before the model record is retrieved. You can inspect the `this` context to access important information, such as the query parameters, the user performing the action, and the environment in which the action is happening.

### After Get Hook

### Rule Structure

```typescript
import mercury from "@mercury-js/core";
// Define an after hook for the "get" action
mercury.hook.after("GET_DOCUMENT_RECORD", (this: any) => {
  console.log("After Retrieving Document: ", this);
});
```

    options: {
        root: { mercuryResolvers: [Object] },
        args: { input: [Object] },
        ctx: {
            // context of the user using mercuryjs
        },
        internal: false,
        populate: [],
        select: [ 'id', 'name' ]

}
```

- `name`: Specifies the name of the model being processed. In this case, it is set to 'Document', indicating the operation involves a document-related entity in the system.
- `record`: Stores all the details about the document. It represents the actual document being retrieved from the database.
- `user`: Contains metadata about the user who is performing the operation, such as retrieving a document.
  - `profile`: Represents the role or profile of the user making the request (e.g., 'ADMIN'). This field may be used to apply permissions or role-based access control during the operation.
- `options`: Contains additional metadata about the request, including resolver information, arguments, and selection options.
  - `root`: Connects to the database and handles how the model is processed based on the query or mutation.
  - `args`: Captures the input provided to the operation, such as form data or request parameters. In GraphQL operations, this includes the input fields for mutations or queries (like the documentName).
  - `ctx`: Context of the request, including user data, headers, and control symbols.
    - user: Represents additional details about the user making the request, typically used for authentication and authorization checks.
  - internal: Boolean indicating whether this is an internal request.
  - populate: Specifies which related fields to populate.
  - select: Fields selected for the response (e.g., id, name).

**Purpose of the Hook:**
The after hook allows you to perform tasks or trigger logic after the document retrieval has been finalized. Some common use cases include:

- Logging information about the retrieved document.
- Triggering additional workflows, such as sending notifications.
- Updating related data or records based on the retrieved document.
- Auditing and tracking retrieval events for monitoring or debugging purposes.

  ## 5.Paginate Hook

This hook allows you to execute logic before and after List or Paginate a document record.

### Before Paginate Hook

### Rule Structure

```typescript
import mercury from "@mercury-js/core";
// Define a before hook for the "create" action
mercury.hook.before("PAGINATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD", (this:any) => {
  console.log("Before List  Document: ", this);
});
```

This **"PAGINATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD"** hook allows custom logic to execute before a document is paginated or listed. It's useful for post-update processing like logging, triggering additional workflows, or syncing data to other systems

### Explanation

#### 1. import mercury from "@mercury-js/core"

Mercury.js provides the tools to handle actions and events in your application. By importing Mercury, you can define hooks for various model actions, such as before paginate or list a document.

#### 2. mercury.hook.before("PAGINATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD", function(this: any){ })

Registers an before hook that listens for the "PAGINATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD" event. The hook will trigger before a document record has been paginate or listed.

#### 3. "PAGINATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD"

This string represents the specific action tied to the paginate or list of a document model record. The hook runs before the document paginate or list process is completed.

#### 4. function (this: any)

The callback function is executed before the "PAGINATE_DOCUMENT_RECORD" action, providing access to the context and state at the time of the paginate or list.

#### What this Represents

before the document is paginated or updated, the this object will contain relevant information about the paginate or list process:
